# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Problem Statement
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the StackOverflow Developer Survey dataset, which contains responses from developers worldwide. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of the developer community, such as demographics, programming languages, job satisfaction, and more. By exploring the data, we aim to answer the following questions:
* Q1) What are the most popular languages?
* Q2) What are the most common languages used by developers older than 40 years of age?
* Q3) What are the most common languages used by developers in Canada?
* Q4) Which languages are the most people interested to learn over the next year?
* Q5) In which countries do developers work the highest number of hours per week? Consider countries with more than 200 responses only.
* Q6) How important is it to begin early in order to build a career in programming?
* Q7) What are the most common countries of residence among the survey respondents between 18-30(early career)?
* Q8) How satisfied are developers with their jobs?
* Q9) What are the most commonly used database technologies among developers, and is there a relationship between the choice of a database and the developer's years of coding experience?
* Q10) What are the differences in the average weekly working hours among developers from various ethnic backgrounds, specifically focusing on White, Latino/Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Black individuals)
