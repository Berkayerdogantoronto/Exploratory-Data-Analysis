# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Problem Statement
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the StackOverflow Developer Survey dataset, which contains responses from developers worldwide. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of the developer community, such as demographics, programming languages, job satisfaction, and more. By exploring the data, we aim to answer the following questions:
* Q1) What are the most popular languages?
* Q2) What are the most common languages used by developers older than 40 years of age?
* Q3) What are the most common languages used by developers in Canada?
* Q4) Which languages are the most people interested to learn over the next year?
* Q5) In which countries do developers work the highest number of hours per week? Consider countries with more than 200 responses only.
* Q6) How important is it to begin early in order to build a career in programming?
* Q7) What are the most common countries of residence among the survey respondents between 18-30(early career)?
* Q8) How satisfied are developers with their jobs?
* Q9) What are the most commonly used database technologies among developers, and is there a relationship between the choice of a database and the developer's years of coding experience?
* Q10) What are the differences in the average weekly working hours among developers from various ethnic backgrounds, specifically focusing on White, Latino/Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Black individuals)

And moreover in the project, By addressing these questions, we seek to provide valuable insights into the developer community, helping developers, employers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions based on the data-driven findings.
## Conclusions
* Based on the demographics of the survey respondents, we can conclude that the survey is relatively representative of the overall programming community. However, it received fewer responses from programmers from non-English-speaking nations, as well as from women and non-binary genders.
* Although the majority of programmers have a college degree, many of them did not major in computer science. As a result, a computer science degree is not required to learn to code or pursue a career in programming.
* A significant portion of programmers work part-time or as freelancers, which can be an excellent way to break into the sector, especially if you're just starting out.
*
