# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Problem Statement
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the StackOverflow Developer Survey dataset, which contains responses from developers worldwide. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of the developer community, such as demographics, programming languages, job satisfaction, and more. By exploring the data, we aim to answer the following questions:
* Q1) What are the most popular languages?
* Q2) What are the most common languages used by developers older than 40 years of age?
* Q3) What are the most common languages used by developers in Canada?
* Q4) Which languages are the most people interested to learn over the next year?
* Q5) In which countries do developers work the highest number of hours per week? Consider countries with more than 200 responses only.
* Q6) How important is it to begin early in order to build a career in programming?
* Q7) What are the most common countries of residence among the survey respondents between 18-30(early career)?
* Q8) How satisfied are developers with their jobs?
* Q9) What are the most commonly used database technologies among developers, and is there a relationship between the choice of a database and the developer's years of coding experience?
* Q10) What are the differences in the average weekly working hours among developers from various ethnic backgrounds, specifically focusing on White, Latino/Hispanic, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Black individuals)

And moreover in the project, By addressing these questions, we seek to provide valuable insights into the developer community, helping developers, employers, and other stakeholders make informed decisions based on the data-driven findings.
## Conclusions
* Based on the demographics of the survey respondents, we can conclude that the survey is relatively representative of the overall programming community. However, it received fewer responses from programmers from non-English-speaking nations, as well as from women and non-binary genders.
* In Canada, the most commonly used programming languages among developers are JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, and Python. JavaScript is a popular choice for web development, HTML/CSS is crucial for building web pages, SQL is needed for database management, and Python is versatile for various tasks. These languages play key roles in Canadian software development, reflecting the country's focus on web technologies, data management, and a diverse software landscape.

* Although the majority of programmers have a college degree, many of them did not major in computer science. As a result, a computer science degree is not required to learn to code or pursue a career in programming.
* A significant portion of programmers work part-time or as freelancers, which can be an excellent way to break into the sector, especially if you're just starting out.
* Python is the language that most people want to learn since it is a simple general-purpose programming language that can be used in a variety of domains.
* At any age, you can learn and begin a career in programming. If you enjoy programming as a pastime, you're more likely to have a long and satisfying career.
* Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in, closely followed by SQL & Python.
* Looking ahead to the next year, it's clear that many people want to learn specific programming languages. Python is at the top, likely because it's used in a wide range of jobs, from websites to data work. JavaScript is a close second because it's vital for web development, while HTML/CSS are the basics of web design. SQL is important for managing data, and TypeScript is gaining interest for making web projects more stable and reliable. These choices show a desire to gain skills that are practical, in-demand, and open doors to different job opportunities in the world of programming.
* Iran, Israel, and China have the highest working hours, followed by the United States. However, there isn't a difference between work hours and the average working hours seem to be around 40 hours per week.
* India and the United States stand out as the leading contributors to this demographic, underscoring the international nature of the software industry. Additionally, the strong representation of countries from Europe, South America, and North America suggests that early-career developers are distributed across various regions, reflecting the diverse and dynamic nature of the developer community in these age brackets.
* Most developers express satisfaction with their jobs, with "Very Satisfied" and "Slightly Satisfied" being the predominant responses, while a smaller minority holds stronger feelings of dissatisfaction.
* The analysis reveals a significant relationship between a developer's choice of database technologies, starting with MySQL, followed by PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB, and Oracle, and their years of coding experience. The substantial Chi-squared value (151,173.44) indicates variations in the preferences for these database technologies, while the extremely low p-value (approximately 6.36e-280) confirms this relationship as non-random. In practical terms, this underscores that developers with different experience levels tend to favor distinct database technologies, emphasizing the importance of considering these preferences within the software development community.
